# JavaPracticeStuff

My idea for this is to have regular commits (daily is the goal (written 4/2/21)) for all of the Java stuff i have been
practicing / reviewing on my own. 

Have the repo for myself to keep track of everything I have reviewed / learned. Rather than do stuff and then let is sit
around on my computer or worse yet use an online code editor for algorithm practice and then never look at the code again. 

*** Will add more as my idea evolves. 

*** Like my Java practice diary.
